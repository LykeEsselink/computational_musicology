### Welcome to my main page!

This is the main page. I can introduce people to my portfolio here.

This sidebar goes on the right of the subsection that we are in.



### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Week 8

```{r, echo=FALSE}
wood <- read_csv("dat/wood.csv")

wood |>
  compmus_wrangle_chroma() |> 
  mutate(pitches = map(pitches, compmus_normalise, "euclidean")) |>
  compmus_gather_chroma() |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = start + duration / 2,
      width = duration,
      y = pitch_class,
      fill = value
    )
  ) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "Time (s)", y = NULL, fill = "Magnitude") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

Here is a plot from last week's lab. It shows the chromagram for the "wood" dataset that we could download from the lab notes.
